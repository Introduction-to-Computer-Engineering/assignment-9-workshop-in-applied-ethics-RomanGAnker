1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

If everybody in a certain civilization was ethical, there would be many social structures that would not be in place today. Most importantly, the system of law and justice would be an unnecessary social tool in an entirely ethical society. The sole purpose of the justice system is to reform and seclude individuals who have either committed unethical actions or attempted to committ unethical actions. It is extremely unlikely that this type of civilization would ever exist, but if it did; the most apparent and obvious social system that would begin to collect dust would be the justice system. 

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

I think the most tragic and terrible event in modern history that favored the group and discarded the minority was the holocaust. The results of the holocaust were devastating and ultimately led to the deaths of millions of innocent people and millions of service members across the world who died fighting to stop it. The issue with Germany during this time was the leadership who was making the big decisions. Hitler led his whole campaign on bringing Germany back to being a strong country following the repercussions of WWI. One of the issues that he was very firm on was the "Jewish Question" and how the jews were a flaw in the country.
The only way this could have been stopped would have been if there was a government in system in place to protect their citizens from a tyrant, but at the time there was not.
